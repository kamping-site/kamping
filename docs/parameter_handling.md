# Passing Parameters in KaMPIng

A core feature of KaMPIng is the flexible named parameters concept, allowing the caller to name and pass parameters in arbitrary order and even omit certain parameters when the library is able to infer them (at the cost of additional computation/communication).
With this approach, KaMPIng allows the user a fine-grained control over the parameter set which will be explained in greater detail in this document.

To illustrate the concept, we first look at the function signature of `MPI_Alltoallv` as defined in MPI-4.0 which takes a `sendbuf` of variable
size on each PE i and sends messages of size `sendcounts[j]` from PE i to PE j where the messages are received into `recvbuf`.
Apart from these three parameters, MPI requires additional information such as the number of elements to receive (`recvcounts[]`) or possible displacements (`sdispls`, `rdispls`) etc.
```cpp
MPI_Alltoallv(const void *sendbuf, const int sendcounts[],
              const int sdispls[], MPI_Datatype sendtype, void *recvbuf,
              const int recvcounts[], const int rdispls[],
              MPI_Datatype recvtype, MPI_Comm comm)
```

In contrast to plain MPI, where the caller has to pass nine parameters to `MPI_Alltoallv`, KaMPIng requires only the `sendbuf` and `sendcounts` parameters.
All other parameters are optional and are computed as follows (if omitted):
- `recvcounts` are inferred through an additional call to `MPI_Alltoall` over the `sendcounts`.
- `sdispls` and `rdispls` are defaulted to an exclusive prefix sum of the `sendcounts` and `recvcounts`, respectively.
- `sendtype` and `recvtype` are inferred from the container's `value_type` storing the data to be sent (or received).

As outlined above, it is possible to pass any subset of the optional parameters, in any arbitrary order, to the wrapped function call.

This flexibility is enabled by KaMPIng's **named parameter** approach: Each argument passed to a wrapped MPI function is identified by a name instead of its position in the complete parameter list as in plain MPI.

Internally, named parameters are realized as factory functions which construct parameter objects inplace, but it's easier to think of this concept in terms of `parameter_name(data)`.
| Parameter Name   | Factory Function In-Parameter | Factory Function Out-Parameter |
| ---------------- | ----------------              | -------------                  |
| send_buf         | send_buf(...)                 | -                              |
| recv_buf         | -                             | recv_buf_out(..)/recv_buf(...) |
| send_counts      | send_counts(...)              | send_counts_out(...)           |
| send_displs      | send_displs(...)              | send_displs_out(...)           |
| recv_counts      | recv_counts(...)              | recv_counts_out(...)           |
| ...              | ...                           | ...                            |

(See [List of Named Parameters](<named_parameters.md#List Of Named Parameters>) for a list of all named parameters currently used in KaMPIng.)

The named parameters passed to a wrapped MPI function serve either as *in(put)* or *out(put)* parameters.
Through a named *in* parameter, the caller can provide input data to the wrapped MPI call, as exemplified by `send_buf(data_to_send)` or `send_counts(counts)` with `data_to_send` and `counts` accomodating the data to be sent and send counts, respectively.
Using named out parameter the caller asks KaMPIng to internally compute/infer this parameter and output its value. Named output parameters are created via the respective `*_out()` suffix.
The data requested via out parameters is then either directly written to a memory location passed to the named parameter factory function or returned in a `std::tuple`-like *result* object (depending on the ownership property, see [Ownership](named_parameters.md#Ownership)).

One special case is the receive buffer (`recv_buf(...)`). Although being an out parameter, it does not need to be explicitly given as KaMPIng assumes that a caller always wants to obtain this buffer.

See the following examples for an illustration of the different options

```cpp
  std::vector<T> data = ...;          // initialize data to send
  std::vector<int> send_counts = ...; // initialize send counts
  
  {
    // a single (implicit) out parameter: recv buffer
    auto recv_buf = comm.alltoallv(send_buf(data), send_counts(counts));
  }
  {
    // out parameters: recv counts and recv buffer
    auto result = comm.alltoallv(send_buf(data), send_counts(counts), recv_counts_out());
    std::vector<T>   recv_buf    = result.extract_recv_counts();
    std::vector<int> recv_counts = result.extract_recv_buf();
    // or via structured bindings as auto [recv_buf, recv_counts] = comm.alltoallv(...);
  }
  {
    // out parameter data is written to a specific memory location: recv counts and recv buffer
    std::vector<int> recv_counts = ...; // allocate enough memory to hold recv counts
    std::vector<T>   recv_buffer = ...; // allocate enough memory to hold recv elements
    comm.alltoallv(send_buf(data),
                   send_counts(counts),
                   recv_counts_out(recv_counts),
                   recv_buf_out(recv_buffer));
  }
  {
    // out parameter data is written to a specific memory location: recv counts and recv buffer
    // potential resizing is done by KaMPIng
    std::vector<int> recv_counts;
    std::vector<T>   recv_buffer;
    comm.alltoallv(send_buf(data),
                   send_counts(counts),
                   recv_counts_out<resize-to-fit>(recv_counts),
                   recv_buf_out<resize-to-fit>(recv_buffer));
  }
```

To summarize, there are three ways to pass parameters to KaMPIng:
1. **in** parameter: the caller directly provides the parameter required by the MPI call such as the `sendbuf`, `sendcounts`, `recvcounts` etc.
2. **out** parameter: the caller does not provide the parameter but asks KaMPIng to internally compute/infer the parameter and return the value to the caller.
3. **omitted** parameter: the caller does not provide the parameter and (implicitly) asks KaMPIng to internally compute/infer the parameter but is not interested in its value. Therefore it is discared once the wrapped MPI call has completed.

**Note**: KaMPIng will show an error message at compile time if any required parameter is missing.

Internally, a call to a named parameter factory function (`send_buf(...), send_counts(...), ...`) instantiates an object of the *DataBuffer/DataBufferBuilder* class encapsulating
all passed data/memory and user request regarding potential output strategies.

## Named Parameters and DataBuffers
To fully benefit from KaMPIng's parameter flexibility, we briefly present the most important concepts of the `DataBuffer` class.
A `DataBuffer` wraps either a single value or a whole underlying C++ container. In the latter case, KaMPIng requires the container to 
- have contiguous memory,
- expose its `value_type`
- have a member function `data()` returning a pointer to the start of its memory
- have and a member function `size()` returing the container's size.

If resizing of the container is requested, KaMPIng additionally requires the container to expose a `resize(unsigned int)` member function (see [Resize Policy](named_parameters.md#Resize Policy)).

Futhermore, `DataBuffer` has multiple (orthogonal) properties with which the caller can control the behavior of corresponding parameter inside the wrapped MPI call:
- type: <in, out, (inout)>
- ownership: <owning, non-owning>
- resize-policy: <no-resize, grow-only, resize-to-fit>

### Parameter Type

Named parameters factory functions like `send_counts(...)`, `recv_counts(...)` , ... generate `DataBuffers` with type property *in*.
This signals that they wrap a container with meaningful *input* data which can be used by the MPI call directly, e.g. the send counts wrapped by `send_counts(...)`.

The corresponding `*_out` named parameters instantiates `DataBuffer` objects with type property *out*.
They do not contain meaningful data yet and will be filled with values during the wrapped MPI call.

`DataBuffers` with type *inout* correspond to named parameters like `send_recv_buf(...)` used in `MPI_Bcast` where data is sent on one root rank (in parameter) and received (out parameter) on all other ranks.
Furthermore, passing `send_recv_buf(...)` to wrapped MPI routines such as `MPI_Allreduce, MPI_Allgather,...` indicates that the *inplace* version (`MPI_INPLACE`) will be used.
See the corresponding Doxygen documentation for more information.

### Ownership
This property simply determines whether a `DataBuffer` owns its underlying data following the corresponding C++ ownership concept and is most important for out parameters.
A `DataBuffer` *references* (*non*-owns) its container if the latter has been passed to the named parameter as an lvalue as in `send_buf(data)` or `recv_buf_out(recv_buffer)`.
Otherwise a `DataBuffer` is *owning*, e.g. for `recv_buf_out()`, `recv_buf_out(std::move(recv_buffer))`.

Note that a named (out) parameter without associated underlying container (such as `recv_buf_out()`) implies that the caller asks KaMPIng to allocate the memory to hold the computed/infered values.
This results in an owning container, which is allocated by KaMPIng and ownership is transferred to the caller upon return.

Furthermore, the ownership of an out parameter is important as it specifies how the computed data will be returned to the caller.
Owning out parameters are moved to a result object which is returned by value.
Non-owning out parameters write their data directly to their associated underlying container.
Therefore, the `DataBuffer` object corresponding to this named parameter will not be part of the result object.
The following code provides some example for owning and non-owning out parameters:

```cpp
  // owning out parameters:
  {
    auto result = comm.alltoallv(send_buf(data),
                                 send_counts(counts),
                                 recv_buf_out(),
                                 recv_counts_out());
    auto recv_buffer = result.extract_recv_buffer();
    auto recv_counts = result.extract_recv_counts();
    // auto send_counts = result.extract_send_counts() // compilation error: this cannot be extracted
                                                       // since it is not specified as an out parameter.
  }
  
  // owning out parameters with structured bindings:
  {
    auto [recv_buffer, recv_counts] = comm.alltoallv(send_buf(data),
                                                     send_counts(counts),
                                                     recv_buf_out(),
                                                     recv_counts_out());
  }

  // non-owning out parameters:
  {
    std::vector<T> recv_buffer = ...; // allocate sufficient memory
    std::vector<int> recv_counts;     // allocate sufficient memory
    comm.alltoallv(send_buf(data),
                   send_counts(counts),
                   recv_buf_out(recv_buffer),
                   recv_counts_out(recv_counts));
  }
```

For more information about the result object, we refer to its doxygen documentation.

### Resize Policy
Resize policies are important only for out parameters. They control if and how the underlying memory/container are resized if the provided memory is not large enough to hold the computed values.
- `no_resize`: the underlying container is not resized and the caller has to ensure that it is large enough to hold all data.
- `grow_only`: KaMPIng will resize the underlying container if its initial size is too small. However, a container's size will never be reduced.
- `resize_to_fit`: KaMPIng will resize the underlying container to have exactly the size required to hold all data.

The default resize policy is `no-resize` (except for empty named out parameters such as `recv_buf_out()` or `recv_counts_out()`).
For `grow-only` or `resize-to-fit` KaMPIng requires the container to posess a member function `resize(unsigned integer)` taking an (unsigned) integer specify the requested number of elements of tye `value_type` which the container should store.
Note that KaMPIng can resize `recv_buf` only if the corresponding `recv_type` matches the size of the underlying container's `value_type`. Otherwise the user must ensure that the container is large enough and only `no-resize` is allowed.

```cpp
  std::vector<T>    recv_buffer;                
  std::vector<int>  recv_counts(comm.size());   
  
  comm.alltoallv(send_buf(data),                           // no resize policy necessary, as in parameters are read-only const
                 send_counts(counts),                      // no resize policy necessary, as in parameters are read-only const
                 recv_buf_out<resize_to_fit>(recv_buffer), // will be resized by KaMPIng
                 recv_counts_out<no_resize>(recv_counts)   // has to be large enough to hold all recv counts
                );
```
