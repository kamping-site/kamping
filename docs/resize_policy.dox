#### Note on Resize Policy

The underlying container/storage of an out parameter encapsulating a data buffer (e.g. `recv_buf`/`recv_counts`, etc.) will be resized according to the parameter's resize policy:
- kamping::BufferResizePolicy::no_resize: no resizing will occur and the underlying storage must be large enough to hold all elements (default).
- kamping::BufferResizePolicy::grow_only: resizing will only occur if the underlying storage is not large enough to hold all elements.
- kamping::BufferResizePolicy::resize_to_fit: the underlying storage will be resized to exactly the number of elements (e.g. number of received elements for the recv_buf, etc.)

If a `send_/recv_/send_recv_type` parameter is provided, kamping::BufferResizePolicy::no_resize for receive buffers is required, as KaMPIng can no longer ensure a 1:1 mapping between MPI_Datatype and the underlying storage's C++ type.
