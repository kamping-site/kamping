Coding Guidelines {#coding_guidelines}
============
# General
We are writing a header-only library.
Using the provided `.clang-format` library is mandatory. The CI will reject non-conforming pull-requests.


# Scoping and Naming
* We are working in the `kamping` (KaMPI.ng) namespace to avoid polluting the user's namespace with trivial names as `in`, `out`, or `root`.
* Everything that is not user facing lives in the `internal` namespace.
* Classes and structs start with an Upper case letter and are using CamelCase.
* Start variables, attributes, functions, and members with a lower case letter. Use `snake_case`, that is, separate words by an underscore (\_). Write acronyms in lower case letters, e.g., `partitioned_msa` and `generate_mpi_failure`. This also applies to KaMPI.ng -> `kamping`.
* Use the above naming scheme for wrapped MPI functions without adding underscores where the corresponding MPI function doesn't have one.
* `struct`s have only trivial methods if at all, everything more complicated has to be a `class`. `struct`s are always forbidden to have private members or functions.
* `std::pair` leads to hard to read code. Use named pairs (`struct`s) instead.
* Private attributes and member functions *start* with an underscore, e.g., `_name` or `_clear_cache()`.
* Getters and setters are overloaded methods, for example `author.name()` is a getter and `author.name("Turing")` the corresponding setter.
* For methods which return a boolean, consider prefixing the name with `is`, e.g., `is_valid()` instead of `valid()`
* Methods which return a number with non-obvious unit should have the unit as a postfix, for example `length_px()` instead of `length()`.
* Declare methods and attributes in the following order: `public`, `protected`, `private`. Inside these regions: `using` (typedefs) and (scoped) `enum`s, `struct`s and `class`es, attributes, methods.
* Use `.cpp` and `.hpp` as file endings. File names are lowercase and separate word using an underscore. For example `sparse_all2all.hpp`.
* Name local variables with full names. If a name would get too long, write a comment explaining the full meaning of the variable. Use acronyms very sparingly. Some allowed acronyms: `len` for `length (of)`, `num` for `number (of)`, `mpi`.
* Use informative names for templated types. "T1" etc. is only allowed for very general code. Template names are in CamelCase (like classes), e.g. `GeneratorFunction`.
* Types defined with `using` inherit the naming rules of the type they are aliasing.

# Writing Tests
For details on how to write tests see the [Testing Guidelines](testing_guidelines.md).

# Rules for functions
TODO \@Demian \@Matthias: Rules for API
* For internal functions: Return output only values via the `return` statement, even multiple return values.
* For internal functions: Return in-output values via a reference argument.
* Mark the parameters as `const` where possible.
* Mark member functions as `const` where possible. Use `mutable` for caches to be able to keep getters `const`. 
* Add MPI wrapper functions to `Communicator` using [CRTP](https://www.fluentcpp.com/2017/05/16/what-the-crtp-brings-to-code/) mixins: Create a new class that inherits from `CRTPHelper` with protected constructor, without any member variables, and `Communicator` as template parameter where you implement your functionality. Then let `Communicator` inherit from your new class. See the corresponding test in `tests/mpi_function_wrapper_helpers_test.cpp` for an example.
* Implement related MPI functions in the same class (like `send`, `recv`, and `sendrecv`).
* Use templated methods instead of passing a function pointer etc. as this allows the compiler to inline the function. Use `static_assert` to check the signature of the function being passed as an argument.
* Implicit conversions are forbidden, constructors with only one parameter have to be marked as `explicit`.
* Is one of the following functions declared, either implement, `default`, or `delete` all the others: Constructor, copy constructor, move constructor, copy assignment operator, move assignment operator, destructor. If you don't need some of them and don't want to think about if they would be easy to implement, `delete` them. Either way, write a comment explaining either why you think they should not be implemented, are hard to implement, or that you don't need them and didn't want to bother implementing them.

# Header files and includes
* Use `#pragma once` instead of include guards, as it is available on all important compilers.
* Include all used headers, don't rely on transitive inclusions. Maybe use `include-what-you-use` to check.
* The `#include` statements will be automatically grouped and sorted by clang-format: STL headers come first, then other system headers followed by KaMPI.ng headers.
* Do not use `using namespace` in header files as this would then also apply to all files including this header file.
* Use the `kamping/` prefix when including our own header files.

# General
* Use east side `const`.
* Use the more concise `size_t` over `std::size_t`. Do not put `using size_t = std::size_t` into your code.
* Use `nullptr` instead of `NULL` or `0`.
* Use `using` instead of `typedef`.
* Use `sizeof` instead of constants.
* Use C++ style casts; if possible, use `asserting_cast<destType>(srcValve)` or `throwing_cast<destType>(srcValue)`.
* Use `//` instead of `/* */` for comments, even multi-line comments.
* Add Doxygen documentation for each (!) function and member variable, even private ones. Describe what this function does, which parameters it takes and what the return value is. Also describe all assumptions you make. This rule applies to all functions, even trivial ones.
* Start comments describing TODOs with `// TODO ...`. This allows grepping for TODOs.
* Use almost always `auto`.
* Use scoped `enum`s instead of unscoped `enum`s.
* Prefer smart pointers over raw pointers.
* Avoid `std::bind`, use lambda functions instead as they result in better readability and allow the compiler to inline better.
* Use the subset of `C++` which compiles in `gcc10`, `clang10` and `icc19`.
* Use the `KASSERT()` macro with the appropriate assertion level to validate the internal state of your code or user supplied data.
* Use the `THROW_IF_MPI_ERROR()` macro for MPI errors.

# Short-circuit evaluation in KASSERT() macros
Since we overload the `&&` and `||` operators, `KASSERT` cannot short circuit assertion expressions.
This can lead to unexpected behaviour, for instance:

```cpp
KASSERT(ptr != nullptr && ptr->check_sth()); // might seg fault if ptr == nullptr
// or
KASSERT(!pe_is_root() || [&]{
    KASSERT(/* Stuff that matters only on root. */);
}()); // The lambda is evaluated on *all* PEs.
```

This is impossible to fix since C++ does not allow us to overload the `&&` and `||` operators while preserving short-circuit evaluation.
Therefore, it is not allowed to write
```cpp
KASSERT(false && true);
```
Instead, add an extra pair of parenthesis:
```cpp
KASSERT((false && true));
```

# Warnings
Code *should* compile with `clang` and `gcc` (not `icc`) without warning with the warning flags given below. If you want to submit code which throws warnings, at least two other persons have to agree. Possible reasons for this are: False-positive warnings.

# Tooling
* Use "modern" CMake as build system
* Use Doxygen for documentation. TODO \@Florian: Which style?
* Use `git submodule` to include dependencies. TODO: Explain in the README, how to work with git submodules.
* Write *many* unit tests for your code. If there is no unit test for it, it does not exist. Also check for nonsensical inputs and edge cases.
