/// @brief Distributed timer object.
///
/// ## Timer hierarchy: ##
/// The timer is able to execute time measurements in a hierarchical manner.
/// Time measurements are executed with a matching pair of calls to Timer::start() and Timer::stop().
/// Each call to start() enters a new level in the hierarchy which is left again with the corresponding call to
/// stop(). Time measurements can be nested and the parent time measurement remains active while its child time
/// measurement take place.
///
/// See the following pseudocode example:
///
/// \code
/// Timer timer;
/// timer.start("algorithm");
///   timer.start("preprocessing");
///   timer.stop();                       // stops "preprocessing" measurement
///     timer.start("core_algorithm");
///       timer.start("subroutine");
///       timer.stop();                   // stops "subroutine" measurement
///   timer.stop();                       // stops "core_algorithm" measurement
///   timer.start("postprocessing");
///   timer.stop();                       // stops "postprocessing" measurement
/// timer.stop();                         // stops "algorithm" measurement
///
/// timer.aggregate_and_print(Printer{}); // aggregates measurements across all participating ranks and print results
/// \endcode
///
/// This corresponds to the following timing hierarchy:
///
/// \code
/// // Measurement key          Duration
/// // ----------------------------------
/// // algorithm:...............6.0 sec
/// // |-- preprocessing:.......1.0 sec
/// // |-- core_algorithm:......4.0 sec
/// // |   `-- subroutine:......2.0 sec
/// // `-- postprocessing:......2.0 sec
/// \endcode
///
/// ## Aggregation operations ##
///
/// There are two types of aggregation operations:
///
/// 1) Local aggregation operations - It is possible to execute measurements with the same key multiple times. Local
/// aggregation operations specify how these repeated time measurements will be stored. Currently, there are two
/// options - stop_and_add() and stop_and_append(). See the following examples:
///
/// \code
/// timer.start("foo");
/// timer.stop_and_add();
/// timer.start("foo");
/// timer.stop_and_add();
/// \endcode
/// The result of this program is one stored duration for the key "foo" which is the sum of the durations for the two
/// measurements with key "foo".
///
/// The other option to handle repeated measurements with the same key is stop_and_append():
/// \code
/// timer.start("bar");
/// timer.stop_and_append();
/// timer.start("bar");
/// timer.stop_and_append();
/// \endcode
///
/// This program results in a list with two durations for the key "bar". We call the  number of durations
/// stored for a key its \c dimension.
///
/// 2) Global (communicator-wide) aggregation operations specify how the stored duration(s) for a specific measurement
/// key shall be aggregated. The default operation (if no operations are specified via the stop() method) is to take the
/// maximum duration over all ranks in the communicator. If there are multiple durations for a certain key, the
/// aggregation operation is applied element-wise and the result remains a list with the same size as the number of
/// input durations. The communicator-wide aggregation operation are applied in the evaluation phase started with
/// calls to aggregate() or aggregate_and_print().
///
///
/// The timer hierarchy that is implicitly created by start() and stop() must be the same on all ranks in the given
/// communicator. The number of time measurements with a specific key may vary as long as the number of stored duration
/// are the same:
/// Consider for example a communicator of size two and rank 0 and 1 both measure the time of a function \c
/// foo() each time it is called using the key \c "computation". This is only valid if either each rank calls foo()
/// exactly the same number of times and local aggregation happens using the mode \c append, or if the measured time is
/// locally aggregated using add, i.e. the value(s) stored for a single key at the same hierarchy level must have
/// matching dimensions.
/// Furthermore, global communicator-wide duration aggregation operations specified on ranks other than the root rank
/// are ignored.
///
///
/// @see The usage example for Timer provides some more information on how the class can be used.
///
