/// The \c MPI calls wrapped by KaMPIng do not rely on the restricting positional parameter paradigm but use named
/// parameters instead. The ParameterTypes defined in this enum are necessary to implement this approach, as KaMPIng
/// needs to identify the purpose of each (unordered) argument.
/// Note that not all enum entries are necessary in each wrapped \c MPI call.
